## Overview

Excel template that should help with recording of time worked.

The template comes with a set of *VBA*-Macros, in order to provide
support when

  - looking for the current date,
  - adding the respective day type (e.g.Â work, flexday, etc.),
  - inserting the timestamps for start and end, and
  - calculating the break time.

In addition, the tool calculates the time worked for each day plus the
*+/-*-values.

A *pivot table* can be used to get an overview of what was recorded
(aggregated by month/calenderweek and type,resp.).
