Overview
--------

Excel template that should help with recording of time worked.

The template comes with a set of _VBA_-Macros, in order to provide support when
- looking for the current date, 
- adding the respective day type (e.g. work, flexday, etc.),
- inserting the timestamps for start and end, and
- calculating the break time.

In addition, the tool calculates the time worked for each day plus the _+/-_-values.

A _pivot table_ can be used to get an overview of what was recorded (aggregated by month/calenderweek and type,resp.).
